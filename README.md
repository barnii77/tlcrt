# About this project
This project is the TLCaml runtime (tlcrt). If you are looking for the language TLCaml, this is not it :(

# TLCaml
Typeless Caml... It only has integers and arrays. All interesting type constructs (strings, ...) have to be built manually. It should be fast though :)

# Building
See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)

# Testing
See [TEST.md](TEST.md)
